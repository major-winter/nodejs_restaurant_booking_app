            <h1>About the villa</h1>
            <p>A place where Chef Thierry would no longer be bound by the limitations of 5-star hotels or high-end
              restaurants, where he’d previously worked. It would be a creative space to explore French gastronomy at
              his
              own pace, in an environment designed to facilitate the best of what excellent ingredients could offer.
              <br />
              Always fascinated by Asia, Thierry found himself as F&B Director at a resort in Phan Thiet, an
              ultra-luxury
              boutique resort. There he met Tina, his future wife, who was working there at the time.
              <br />
              When they moved to Saigon, Thierry found the opportunity to do what would have been nearly impossible in
              France due to costs: purchase a beautiful villa and shape it into one of Vietnam’s most professional and
              experienced fine dining restaurants.
              <br />
              La Villa has found incredible success after years of rigorous staff training and unrestrained exploration
              of
              French fine cuisine.

            <h1>About The chief</h1>
            <p>On a grey day in France almost 20 years ago, Thierry entered a Vietnamese restaurant for the first time.
              He
              was struck with a sense of curiosity. The space was exotic and brightly lit, a woman sang in Vietnamese on
              the speaker, the cuisine was like nothing he’d seen before.
              <br />
              Inspired by the experience, Thierry soon began a 18-year culinary career.
              Chef Thierry first entered the Michelin-star arena in 2003, when he was hired by famed chef Christian
              Etienne at a restaurant of the same name in Avignon, a commune in Southern France. His next stop was a
              Michelin restaurant in London.
              <br />
              Thierry then took his culinary skills back to France, then to Bora Bora, and
              finally to Vietnam in 2008, where he worked with the 5-star ultra-luxury property for two years.
              In 2010 he arrived in Ho Chi Minh City and opened La Villa with his wife,
              Mrs. Tina Trang Pham.
